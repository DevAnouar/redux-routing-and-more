# Redux, Routing, and More

Simple routing boilerplate using `redux-first-router` (https://github.com/faceyspacey/redux-first-router). Oh, and some `styled-components` css-in-js (https://www.styled-components.com) for good measure.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
